/*Write a program that allows the user to enter a time in seconds and then output how far 
an object would drop if it were in free fall for that length of time. Assume no friction
or resistance from air and a constant acceleration of 32 feet per second due to gravity.
use the equation:
Distance = 1/2 *acceleration *time^2
